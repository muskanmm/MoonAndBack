# I Love You To The Moon And Back
I Love You To The Moon And Back is a photo messaging app that allows users to connect with their friends. The app was created with the goal of allowing people to stay up to date with their long distance friends and family. Users can send "wishes" to their friends for photos, and friends can send "shooting stars" back.

We created the app using Swift in XCode.
